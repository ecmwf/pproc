PProc is a framework to run meteorological data processing workflows operaionally at ECMWF.

## Stand-alone tools

These tools are designed to be easily used on their own.

  * pproc-interpol: Perform interpolation and regridding

## Tools intended for operational suites

These tools are designed to be integrated in operational workflows

  * pproc-accumulate: Perform generic accumulations
  * pproc-clustereps: Perform ensemble clustering (using K-Means). Wrapper around the following:
    * pproc-clustereps-pca: Principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction
    * pproc-clustereps-cluster: Perform K-Means clustering in PC space
    * pproc-clustereps-attr: Attribute clustering results to climatological regimes
  * pproc-ensms: Compute ensemble means and standard deviations
    * pproc-wind: Compute ensemble means and standard deviations on wind fields (u/v, wind speed, etc.)
  * pproc-extreme: Compute EFI and Shift of Tails
  * pproc-histogram: Compute histograms
  * pproc-probabilities: Compute probabilities
    * pproc-anomaly-probabilities: Compute probabilities on anomalies
  * pproc-pts: Compute probabilities of tropical storm based on tracks
  * pproc-quantiles: Compute quantiles from an ensemble
  * pproc-significance: Compute significance based on a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test
  * pproc-thermal-indices: Compute thermal indices (see [thermofeel](https://github.com/ecmwf/thermofeel))
